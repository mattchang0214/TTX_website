# Tufts Textbook Exchange Website

The Tufts Community Union (TCU) Senate hosts a textbook exchange event every semester. Students will bring their textbooks to the TCU Senate, tell the Senate how much to sell the textbooks for, and the Senate will sell the books on their behalf. Currently, a Google Document is used to keep track of the textbooks and their sellers, and emails notifying sellers of transactions are sent manually. This site serves to facilitate this process: Sellers can post their books onto the main page, where it is visible to everyone. At the textbook exchange event, once a textbook has been marked as sold, an email will be sent to the seller automatically. This site will also keep track of how much each seller makes so the TCU Senate knows how much is owed to each seller.
